                    <p class="par2">Rodriguez has revealed that the condition cannot be confirmed within two or three months noting that it takes couple of months of unprotected sex.

“We confirm infertility when the couple that didn’t use family planning methods spends two years of unprotected sexual intercourse without pregnancy. We cannot make the confirmation before two years but rather we do fertility consultations,” he said.

Dr. Rodriguez advises couples to go for consultations after spending six months without pregnancy to detect their problem early and start medication.

He explained that both couples should go for check-ups together because infertility is a condition for both men and women.

“You cannot talk about infertility for couples because it involves two people. The man and woman. There is particular infertility cause for a man and woman and cause for both of them. We treat both men and women,” said Dr. Rodriguez.

Infertility can be classified into primary and secondary categories. The primary infertility is when the couple has never been pregnant. The secondary infertility is for those couples who had one or two children, and then after they have been struggling to get another child,” he added.</p>

                    <p class="par2"> Dr. Goyal has said that finger sucking is a usual habit among children that it starts affecting the jaw after three years.

“Finger sucking is normal for a child but it causes side effects if the practice spans for over three years. It starts damaging teeth at this stage and can be harmful if parents do not seek assistance from a dentist,” he said.

Dr. Goyal explained that sucking fingers for over three years damages jaw bones, misaligns and prolongs teeth out of month, and affects nasal respiratory tracts.

Dr. Goyal has however revealed that such anomalies can be corrected.

“When someone has misaligned teeth to the extent that it causes speech impediment, the problem lies in bones structure. We bring them to normal using orthodontics braces. We also conduct surgery to correct the anomaly in case braces are not helpful,” he noted.

Dr. Goyal said that there are unusual braces made from laboratory placed in the mouth of children in age brackets between 8 and 10 to stop misalignment. </p>

                    <p class="par2">Fibromyalgia (FM) is a medical condition characterized by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure.

Other symptoms include tiredness to a degree that normal activities are affected; sleep problems and troubles with memory.

Some people also report restless legs syndrome, bowel or bladder problems, numbness and tingling and sensitivity to noise, lights or temperature. Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder.

Niyigena has explained that the condition which is in most cases confused with other diseases is incurable.

“Fibromyalgia causes pain in more than one part of the body. A patient can at the same time feel pain on the nape of the neck, back pain, pain legs, knees, tassels, wrist, ankle and other body joints. The condition is incurable and has no specific treatment. A patient can only get painkillers,” she said.

Advise

Niyigena has explained that doing several physical exercises especially swimming helps to lessen pain. She also advised the general public to seek assistance from health workers for tips on suitable sports depending on their conditions.

“Doing regular sports particularly swimming are helpful. It is better to seek assistance or advice from medical doctors for tips of recommended sports because people should do particular exercises depending on their age,” she noted.

Niyigena also advised patients to avoid pessimism, have enough rest, and sleep appropriately.
